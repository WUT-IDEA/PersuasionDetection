# APCL: Multimodal Propaganda Detection via Anti-persuasion Prompt Enhanced Contrastive Learning

This repo contains the code for ICASSP 2023 paper **Multimodal Propaganda Detection via Anti-persuasion Prompt Enhanced Contrastive Learning**. 

More details and instructions coming soon!

## Notes:

This article is a multi-label classification task with 22 labels. Our solution is to convert this task into 22 binary classification tasks. Here, we upload a model to detect the **"Name calling/Labeling"** category, and the code is basically consistent for other category detection models.

## Dataset

The memes data of SemEval2021 task 6 is used as our experimental dataset.
